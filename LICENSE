All hands be permitted t’ copy ‘n distribute this here License scroll, word fer word. But mark me words—ye shan’t alter the License itself.

## ☠️ Preamble

Arr! This be a copyleft license fer code ‘n other works.

Most licenses be drafted t’ shackle yer freedom, denyin’ ye the right t’ share or change yer code. This one—this here GNU General Public License—be meant t’ guard yer freedom, makin’ sure every scallywag can run, share, ‘n modify the code as free software fer all crew that sails with it.

When we say “free,” we mean liberty, not doubloons. This License makes sure:

* Ye can pass copies ‘round (charg’n coin or no).
* Ye can get yer hands on th’ source, aye.
* Ye can tinker, splice, or reuse the code in yer own voyages.
* And ye know the seas be safe fer all to do so.

But t’ protect these freedoms, ye got duties: if ye pass along the booty (copies or modified works), ye must grant yer mates the same rights ye got. Ye can’t hoard the source—ye must pass it on, or tell ‘em where it lies.

If ye change the code, mark it clear, so no man mistakes yer bugs fer the original author’s. And remember: thar be no warranty—if the ship sinks, ye take the loss.

Beware the tricks o’ landlubber merchants: some build devices that let ‘em update code but bar ye from doin’ the same. This License forbids such treachery when it comes to User Products.

And curse the black flag o’ software patents! This License makes sure no king’s patent can turn free code into private loot.

What follows be the rules o’ the seas—terms and conditions fer copyin’, sharin’, and changin’ the works.

Do ye want me t’ fully “translate” the **entire GPL v3** into pirate-speak line by line (that’s a massive rewrite), or just hand ye a **template intro + sample clauses** like above, which ye can drop into yer project fer style without losin’ the legal teeth?
